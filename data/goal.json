                "Jurgen Klopp's 2017 went from bad to worse as Liverpool's 2-0 loss at Hull City was secured by a goal from Everton loanee Oumar Niasse.",
                "The Reds have endured a miserable recent run and their FA Cup victory over fourth-tier Plymouth Argyle remains their only win this year.",
                "Even the return of the influential Sadio Mane to the starting line-up failed to inspire a revival, with Simon Mignolet again at fault for debutant Alfred N'Diaye's opener on the stroke of half-time.",
                "The visitors, who did not register a shot on target in the first half, carried a greater threat after the interval, but saw Philippe Coutinho squander the best of their chances.",
                "Having recorded a 5-1 win over Hull in September, the contrast in the fortunes of Klopp's side then and now was underlined by Niasse's 84th-minute goal – his first in the Premier League.",
                "For the Tigers, revitalised under Marco Silva, a fourth consecutive home win in all competitions has breathed new life into their flourishing survival bid.",
                "Silva made five changes from the battling 0-0 draw against Manchester United, with Kamil Grosicki and Villarreal loanee N'Diaye coming in for maiden outings.",
                "The Portuguese had one alteration forced upon him as Michael Dawson limped out of the warm-up, with Andrea Ranocchia handed a full Premier League debut.",
                "Mane – so often Liverpool's key creative force – was recalled, having been a substitute for the draw with Chelsea following his return from the Africa Cup of Nations.",
                "N'Diaye had an early sight of goal but fluffed his lines to shoot tamely at Mignolet from the edge of the box.",
                "Fellow loanee Omar Elabdellaoui required treatment for a nasty facial injury after an unintentional elbow from James Milner, but returned apparently untroubled by the blow.",
                "The hosts escaped unscathed from a moment of danger in the 21st minute, with Eldin Jakupovic and Harry Maguire getting in each other's way and the loose ball falling to Coutinho, whose effort deflected wide.",
                "And on the stroke of half-time Silva's side had the lead, N'Diaye presented with the simplest of finishes after Mignolet failed to deal with Maguire's header.",
                "Jakupovic was finally tested soon after the restart and initially fumbled Emre Can's diving header, but gathered at the second attempt.",
                "He was much more impressive in keeping out Mane's looping header as the visitors cranked up the pressure, though Abel Hernandez raced through at the other end and may have doubled the lead but for a heavy touch that favoured Mignolet.",
                "Hull were almost made to pay for that in the 66th minute when Coutinho was left with a free strike six yards out, but made a poor connection to slash well wide.",
                "Klopp made two late changes as Divock Origi and Alberto Moreno were thrown into the mix, but within minutes Mane conceded possession high up the pitch to prompt a swift Tigers counter that ended with Niasse coolly slotting in the second.",
                "Jordan Henderson's strike forced a stunning last-minute save from Jakupovic, denying Liverpool even a consolation on another miserable afternoon for the Merseysiders, whose title bid is now surely over."

                "Leonardo Jardim's side, who have scored over 100 goals in all competitions this season, will rue the moment Falcao squandered a chance to make it 3-1 from the spot, as City hit back.",
                "It was Sterling who opened the scoring 26 minutes in, but City quickly surrendered their advantage to Falcao's diving header following a poor clearance from Willy Caballero.",

                "Aguero's 58th-minute leveller was a moment to forget for Subasic, but Stones was next to embarrass himself with an error that allowed Falcao time to fashion a beautiful dinked finish.",

                "The 21-year-old set up Juan Mata's opener in the first half before doubling the lead following a slick counter-attack to give the home side only a fourth win in 10 league games at Old Trafford.",
                "Martial was forced to rubbish rumours this week that he would look to force a move away from United at the end of the season, with Jose Mourinho having restricted him to cup appearances only since he was replaced in the second half of the 1-1 draw with Liverpool on January 15.",
                "Starting on the left of an attacking 4-2-3-1 system, he provided the low cross to allow Mata to open the scoring after 32 minutes, just as the home fans began to grow frustrated, with United dominating but failing to convert chances.",
                "Martial then capped a clever move with a stylish finish to make the points safe with half an hour left, as Mourinho's side preserved a record of having never lost to Watford at home in a league match.",
                "The win moves United to within a point of fourth-place Manchester City ahead of their trip to Bournemouth on Monday and means their unbeaten run now stands at 16 top-flight games.",
                "United's attacking approach looked slick in the opening stages, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Mata and Henrikh Mkhitaryan all failing to capitalise on half-chances before a deflected Martial shot looped narrowly wide.",
                "Jose Holebas whipped a ferocious strike beyond the right-hand post from the left but Paul Pogba almost responded with the opening goal, with Heurelho Gomes leaping to parry away his dipping shot from 25 yards out.",
                "Ibrahimovic volleyed over from inside the box after being picked out by Pogba's clever pass, and Gomes saved well low to his right from the France midfielder's first-time hit as United's pressure began to grow.",
                "Mkhitaryan blazed over and Ibrahimovic headed straight at Gomes from point-blank range, but United finally made their dominance tell with 32 minutes played.",
                "Mkhitaryan combined well with Mata before releasing Martial down the left, and after Ibrahimovic left his low cross, Mata was on hand to steer the ball into the net from six yards out.",
                "De Gea made a fine save to tip away Mauro Zarate's dipping free-kick as Watford started the second half more encouragingly, but a devastating break from United saw Martial double the lead on the hour mark.",
                "Ibrahimovic played a fine first-time pass into Martial's path after good work from Mkhitaryan, and the France international cut back onto his right foot inside the area before slotting a clever finish beneath Gomes' right hand after fooling the goalkeeper into expecting a shot towards the far post.",
                "22- Anthony Martial has been involved in more PL goals for Man Utd than any other player since his debut (22 – 14 goals, 8 assists). Potent.",
                "Watford responded well, M'Baye Niang at last getting the better of Daley Blind only to see his teasing low ball across the six-yard box fail to find a white shirt, before another low cross from the AC Milan loanee was ballooned over the bar by Daryl Janmaat.",
                "De Gea beat away a powerful strike from Troy Deeney and Gomes denied Mkhitaryan from close range, before Martial was withdrawn in the closing stages to a standing ovation from the home fans - and a hug from his manager."

                "For Leicester, a defeat in their 2,000th game in England's top flight leaves them firmly in a relegation fight, with the gap to the bottom three still only one point.",
                "United interestingly opted to match Leicester's 4-4-2 from the start, with Marcus Rashford pushed up alongside Ibrahimovic, and both sides cancelled each other out in a scrappy and uneventful opening 20 minutes.",
                "It was Rashford who missed United's first presentable chance, side-footing over the crossbar after a brilliant run from Mkhitaryan and some good interplay with Mata.",
                "United's frustrations were beginning to show against an initially impressive Leicester rearguard, with Mata a little fortunate to escape with only a yellow card for his late lunge on Vardy, although Kasper Schmeichel made an excellent save low to his right from another close-range Rashford strike.",
                "But just as the teams looked set to go into the break level, United struck in ruthless fashion.",
                "Mkhitaryan netted first, prodding the ball past Robert Huth, racing into the penalty area and firing right-footed beyond Schmeichel despite the goalkeeper getting a touch.",
                "Eighty-eight seconds later, Ibrahimovic doubled the lead, steering Antonio Valencia's low cross from the right back across Schmeichel and into the net after finding clear space 12 yards from goal.",

                "Mata fed Mkhitaryan on the edge of the area and ran through to meet the Armenia captain's sublime reverse pass, before slotting beneath Schmeichel from six yards.",

                "Given their woeful form, a trip to the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan was the last thing Claudio Ranieri needed and Sevilla - without the suspended Jorge Sampaoli on the touchline - routinely found gaps in a porous and passive defence.",

                "Wilfred Ndidi blasted the visitors' first shot on target straight at Sergio Rico, but it did not immediately signal the coming fightback as Vitolo hit the post from an impossible angle before the dithering Morgan and Huth converged on Jovetic, allowing Correa the time and space to finish after the Montenegrin offloaded the ball.",

                "The wing-back's robust challenge on Hector Bellerin that allowed him to score is likely to draw post-match rancour from Arsene Wenger, but the suspended Gunners manager could have no complaints when those alongside him in the stand were brought to their feet in the 53rd minute.",
                "Hazard made his mazy way from his own half to the edge of the Arsenal six-yard box to score the kind of goal that can come to define title triumphs.",
                "Arsenal could muster little in the way of a response as they limply succumbed to a defeat more chastening than the one they dealt out to Antonio Conte's men in September, when the prospect of Wenger besting an elite opponent in the dugout briefly re-emerged.",
                "At Stamford Bridge, as substitute Cesc Fabregas collected Petr Cech's woeful clearance and lobbed into an unguarded net, it was nowhere to be seen.",
                "By the time Olivier Giroud headed a stoppage-time consolation from Nacho Monreal's centre, the fact Liverpool can shave Chelsea's advantage to 10 points by beating Hull City later on Saturday felt of greater significance.",
                "Chelsea's measured playing out from the back has been a feature of their transformation under Conte but goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois and David Luiz passed their way into trouble in the second minute.",
                "Mesut Ozil intercepted and Alex Iwobi's low drive deflected agonisingly wide with Courtois beaten.",
                "The hosts' first opening came from a set-piece when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain brought down Victor Moses and Gary Cahill headed into the turf and over.",
                "Arsenal failed once more to deal with their opponents’ aerial threat when they fell behind.",
                "Costa planted a header from Pedro's excellent right-wing cross against the crossbar and, with Cech peeling himself off the turf, an onrushing Alonso emphatically beat the stationary Bellerin to the rebound.",
                "The groggy Spain right-back was substituted shortly afterwards after failing to recover and Costa fired into the side netting as Chelsea scented blood.",
                "Shkodran Mustafi was redeployed to right-back and earned a booking for clattering Hazard, although the Belgium playmaker recovered sufficiently to orchestrate a flowing 32nd-minute move that ended with Cech unconvincingly spilling Pedro's attempt behind.",
                "Bellerin's replacement Gabriel had a glorious chance to equalise before the break but could not keep his free header down and Courtois acrobatically clawed to safety.",
                "Early in the second period, Laurent Koscielny made a vital challenge on Hazard as the last man but, shortly afterwards, the mercurial Belgian effortlessly shimmied past the France centre-back - having unceremoniously shrugged off Francis Coquelin – to score a stunning solo goal.",
                "Wenger shuffled his pack to little effect – as if rearranging the deck chairs on a once-famous ocean liner – and an increasingly understaffed midfield appeared ever more to Hazard's liking.",
                "His old protege Fabregas applied the final insult in the 85th minute and declined to celebrate. The midfielder was in a small majority as Stamford Bridge lapped up a famous triumph – Giroud offering the briefest punctuation to the party atmosphere."

                "A first-half own goal from Juan Mata had looked enough to give Mark Hughes' side a third win in their last four league encounters at home to United and inflict a damaging blow on the visitors' top-four chances.",
                "Mata missed a golden chance to equalise in the first half, while Paul Pogba also came close, but an organised defensive performance from Stoke kept them at arm's length for much of the contest.",

Marko Arnautovic picked out Erik Pieters' run inside the penalty area, and his low cross clipped the foot of Mata and the leg of David de Gea before nestling in the net.",
                "United at last mustered an effort on target after 27 minutes but Marouane Fellaini's header was comfortably dealt with by Grant, before Mata ballooned the ball over the crossbar with the goal gaping after Zlatan Ibrahimovic picked him out at the far post.",

                "Referee Mark Clattenburg dismissed penalty appeals from Mata after the ball struck the arm of the sliding Pieters but the visitors' efforts continued to yield little by way of chances as the Stoke rearguard stood firm.",
                "Substitute Marcus Rashford curled a good effort narrowly wide of the top corner and Pogba blasted beyond Grant's right-hand post, but there remained a stark lack of attacking inspiration and the Stoke goalkeeper remained largely untroubled.",
                "Rooney headed a half-chance over and Jesse Lingard crashed a shot off the top of the crossbar, but Stoke's resistance was finally ended when Rooney whipped a stunning effort into Grant's top-left corner from a tight angle to earn a dramatic point and a slice of United history."

                "And the Spain international proved pivotal, scoring in the seventh minute of first-half injury time - brought on by a nasty-looking head injury to Ryan Mason - prompting a typically fiery celebration in which he intimated that much of the talk doubting his future at Stamford Bridge was just that.",
                "Cahill wrapped up the victory nine minutes from time to send Chelsea eight points clear at the top of the table, with Arsenal the only other team in the top six to pick up a win this weekend.",
                "The Blues' 13-game winning run at the back end of 2016 had been kick-started at the KCOM Stadium in October, but they were not at their best this time around in the face of stern resistance from Marco Silva's men.",
                "Harry Maguire was influential at both ends of the pitch, Thibaut Courtois was called into regular action and Hull were unlucky to not be awarded a second-half penalty.",
                "Silva's start to life at the club has been positive but a pre-match claim that it was proving \"impossible\" to keep in-demand top scorer Robert Snodgrass - injured for this match - in East Yorkshire could spell trouble.",
                "This was another composed performance for Hull, although Costa immediately looked in the mood, drilling wide with just 10 seconds on the clock.",
                "But the Blues could not keep their foot down early on, with Hull frustrating them until the game was punctuated by an eight-minute period of treatment for Mason after a clash of heads with Cahill.",
                "Hull came out of that break strongly, Maguire marauding out of the back three to force a corner, from which he headed unchallenged at Courtois.",
                "That scare sharpened the hosts.",
                "Marcos Alonso's deflected shot had Eldin Jakupovic scrambling to keep the ball out of the top corner before Eden Hazard began to exert more influence over the game, hitting the byline to cause panic in the Tigers' backline which saw debutant Omar Elabdellaoui stumble into Pedro - referee Neil Swarbrick waved away the penalty appeals.",
                "Again Silva's side hunkered down to stem Chelsea's momentum and Maguire once more tested Courtois, this time with a thunderous 25-yard shot.",
                "But the swollen amount of first-half stoppage time helped the Blues move ahead, Costa slamming home after Victor Moses had burst past Andy Robertson and immediately making his feelings on his situation known.",
                "City were furious to see a clear foul on Abel Hernandez by Alonso in the area go unpunished five minutes into the second half before Courtois saved an effort from Mason's replacement David Meyler and Costa had three shots in quick succession repelled with space opening up.",
                "Curtis Davies limped off to further stretch Silva's thinning resources and the visitors eventually ran out of steam, Cahill heading home unmarked to cap another Chelsea win that restores a healthy cushion at the top."

                "That slump began with a 1-1 draw at West Brom, but the same opponents were ill-equipped to offer similar difficulties to a Spurs side whose speed of thought and foot put them a cut above on this occasion.",

                "Ex-Hammer Zarate ran onto Deeney's pass inside the area on the left, before going to ground under Cheikhou Kouyate's clumsy challenge and earning a penalty. Deeney rattled the spot-kick into the bottom-left corner and Watford were soon on the attack again, seeking a second, as M'Baye Niang lashed over the crossbar.",
                "But the hosts' momentum slowed as the game went on, with Younes Kaboul blocking from both Robert Snodgrass and Antonio at the other end, while West Ham could not profit as Gomes pushed a low cross into the centre of the box.",
                "Watford then lost Zarate to injury moments before the break, having earlier gone down with a knock to his leg. After receiving lengthy treatment on the pitch, the 29-year-old was stretchered off to applause from both sets of supporters.",
                "Janmaat went down shortly after the restart and was also substituted, with pressure growing on the Watford goal as Kouyate and Aaron Cresswell saw respective penalty appeals waved away.",
                "Opportunities finally began to arrive for the visitors, but Gomes crucially dived on Manuel Lanzini's teasing centre and then sprang to his left to keep out Jose Fonte's header.",
                "Although Antonio nodded narrowly wide after storming onto Cresswell's whipped delivery, he was heavily involved in the equaliser. Sprinting clear of Kaboul, the former Nottingham Forest winger's finish clipped both posts before falling kindly at the feet of Ayew, who could hardly miss.",
                "West Ham kept pushing for a decisive second, but when Antonio handled to prevent Isaac Success from launching a counter, he received a second yellow and reduced the visitors to 10 men.",
                "Watford nearly clinched the points in a hectic goalmouth scramble, but Success could not turn the ball past Darren Randolph in the game's last action."

                "Fernando Llorente and Gylfi Sigurdsson dealt a blow to Liverpool's Premier League title chances as Swansea City edged a five-goal thriller 3-2 at Anfield on Saturday.",
                "Sigurdsson proved Swansea's matchwinner as he pounced on a poor defensive clearance from Ragnar Klavan, the Iceland international securing Paul Clement's maiden win and Liverpool's first league loss at home since January 2016.",
                "Adam Lallana and Tom Carroll had the best chances of a lacklustre opening half, but that all changed after the restart as the game burst into life.",
                "Llorente struck his first goals away from the Liberty Stadium to put Swansea 2-0 ahead before Roberto Firmino lifted some of the gloom with his seventh in the league this season.",
                "And the Brazilian dragged his side level with 21 minutes to play with a fine finish as Swansea's defensive frailties reared their head once again.",
                "A dramatic second half had one final twist, though, as Sigurdsson ensured a crucial three points that lifts Swansea out of the bottom three, while leaving Liverpool seven points adrift of Chelsea having played a game more.",
                "Given their imperious home record it was no surprise to see Liverpool dominate possession in the early stages and Emre Can should have got them off the mark from Jordan Henderson's ninth-minute cross.",
                "Liverpool continued to press and Lallana saw an overhead kick clear the crossbar from Firmino's cross, the Brazilian having superbly spun away from Alfie Mawson.",
                "Despite the hosts' control of proceedings it was Swansea who came closest to breaking the deadlock as Carroll’s deflected cross thudded against Simon Mignolet’s right-hand post.",
                "It was a rare threat on the Liverpool goal, though, and the hosts resumed control leading up to the break but a resolute Swansea were able to get crucial blocks in to frustrate them and the Anfield crowd.",
                "And the visitors built on their foundation three minutes into the second half as Llorente poked home from six yards after Federico Fernandez's header had been controlled by Wayne Routledge.",
                "The Spaniard then doubled his tally moments later with a towering heading from Carroll's sensational left-wing cross.",
                "Anfield was not silent for long, though, as Firmino halved the deficit to end a crazy seven-minute spell with a bullet header of his own after Martin Olsson had misjudged James Milner's cross.",
                "It came as no surprise that Liverpool duly equalised after 69 minutes as Firmino got in on the act again, this time the forward chesting a Georginio Wijnaldum cross before lashing past Lukasz Fabianski as Olsson and Jack Cork watched on.",
                "However, the game's next key moment was something of a surprise as Sigurdsson ghosted in at the back post to slide home Swansea's third.",
                "Desperate for another equaliser Liverpool piled the pressure on in the closing minutes, with Fabianski saving from Divock Origi and Dejan Lovren before a late melee saw Lallana's looping effort hit the crossbar as Swansea clung on to their first Premier League win at Anfield."

                "Luis Enrique's side were three goals up within 50 minutes and did not allow Cavani's intervention to foil their bid for a slice of history, Neymar scoring twice before setting up Roberto in astonishing scenes, the second leg ultimately finishing 6-1.",
                "Two scrappy first-half goals – one from Luis Suarez in the third minute – and a Layvin Kurzawa own goal gave a rocking Camp Nou hope of a reversal in the tie.",
                "The home side reduced the deficit further early in the second half when Lionel Messi scored his 11th goal of the competition this season from the penalty spot after Neymar was fouled by Thomas Meunier.",
                "But a great finish from Cavani just after the hour mark – his eighth of a Champions League campaign that has been his most prolific – seemed to have made the difference, before the late heroics from Neymar and Roberto.",
                "The crushing defeat sees PSG beaten by Barca in the knockout stages again having suffered the same fate in 2013 and 2015.",
                "Barca, meanwhile, reach the quarters for the 10th straight season, meaning they are still in with a chance of a treble in Luis Enrique's last season at the helm.",
                "Hopes of a remarkable comeback were stirred after only 150 seconds, Suarez getting the goal.",
                "The Barca forward climbed above indecisive goalkeeper Kevin Trapp and sent a close-range header beyond Meunier on the line after Marquinhos and Marco Verratti had both failed to deal with Rafinha's cross.",
                "PSG had a penalty claim rejected when Julian Draxler's cross struck the arm of a sliding Javier Mascherano, who was in as one of three Barca changes from the first leg.",
                "But the hosts kept up the pressure, with Messi sending a free-kick just over and Neymar seeing a curling effort go just wide.",
                "Lucas Moura, starting for PSG with Angel Di Maria only fit for the bench, sent an effort straight at Marc-Andre ter Stegen, but that was as good as it got from the visitors as Barca struck again five minutes before the break.",
                "It was another scrappy goal, with poor defending from Marquinhos allowing Andres Iniesta to chase down Suarez's flick-on in the area and send a clever back-heel across goal which was sliced into his own net by Kurzawa.",
                "The night went from bad to worse for PSG within three minutes of the restart when referee Deniz Aytekin pointed to the spot after consulting with one of his fellow officials.",
                "The Barca award came when Neymar had surged into the area and been felled by Meunier's head after the defender lost his footing, with Messi stepping up and blasting past Trapp from 12 yards.",
                "PSG almost got a priceless away goal in response when Meunier beat Neymar at the other end and squared for Cavani, whose sliding left-footed effort struck the post from six yards.",
                "Unai Emery then brought on Di Maria for Lucas in desperate search of a goal that did arrive after 62 minutes.",
                "A deep free-kick from Verratti led to Kurzawa getting above Ivan Rakitic to head back into path of Cavani and he dispatched a magnificent dipping finish into the roof of the net, sparking ecstatic scenes from Emery and the away supporters.",
                "Ter Stegen made a key save from Cavani a few moments later after Draxler's throughball sent the PSG striker clear to keep Barca – who now needed a further three goals – alive.",
                "Substitute Arda Turan had a shot cleared off the line by Marquinhos and Messi fired wide from a presentable opening, but Cavani's strike appeared to have stalled the hosts' momentum before a frantic finale.",
                "Barca got a fourth with two minutes left, Neymar finding the top corner with an impressive free-kick that left Trapp rooted to the spot.",
                "He struck again from the penalty spot in the first minute of added time, sending Trapp the wrong way after Suarez had been fouled by Marquinhos.",
                "PSG then had to keep out Barca for the remaining four minutes of the five added, but could not do that as Barca rocked the football world.",
                "The LaLiga side threw Ter Stegen into attack to add to the drama, which saw them seal one of football's most stunning victories when Roberto volleyed in Neymar's pass, sending Luis Enrique, the players and Camp Nou into ecstasy."

                "Eric Dier's hopeful punt forwards caused havoc in the Gent defence and Eriksen pounced to slide the ball beneath Lovre Kalinic and into the net from the edge of the six-yard box.",

                "City really had deserved to be ahead after a searing first-half performance, in which they had laid siege to Lloris's goal but somehow not taken the lead.",
                "But, after Dele Alli nodded Spurs back into the contest, Pep Guardiola was apoplectic as Raheem Sterling was denied a clear penalty and Son Heung-min equalised within a minute.",
                "A pulsating game swung back and forth and there was no end to the drama as debutant Gabriel Jesus was denied a first City goal by the offside flag, forcing City to settle for a draw that ought to have been much more.",
                "A point apiece does little for either side's Premier League ambitions, but completes a fantastic day for leaders Chelsea who also saw Liverpool and Manchester United shell points and could be as many as nine points clear if they beat Hull City at home on Sunday.",
                "Guardiola said pre-match that he may not be good enough to lead City's players but his clear attacking intentions resulted in a fantastic show from the off, with Yaya Toure deployed in a holding role behind Sterling, De Bruyne, David Silva and Sane.",
                "As City succeeded in putting Spurs swiftly on the back foot, Guardiola will have lamented the best of City's chances falling to Pablo Zabaleta, who intercepted a one-two between Sergio Aguero and De Bruyne and scuffed wide.",
                "From the resulting goal kick, Aguero was off-target after Zabaleta tenaciously won the ball back and the right-back was again in the thick of the action as he drove narrowly wide left-footed.",

                "But the City onslaught was ceaseless.",
                "A stooping Sane aimed wide and a diving Lloris plucked Aguero's header before denying the striker one-on-one and punching a sharp Sterling shot as Spurs clung on to reach the interval level - perhaps through more luck than judgement.",
                "But Lloris's judgement abandoned him to hand City control of the game.",
                "The Spurs captain first rushed out to meet a long ball, but succeeded only in heading the ball into Sane, who gleefully rolled into an unguarded net before De Bruyne was afforded similar luxury to tuck home after Lloris had inexplicably spilled Sterling's cross.",
                "But the visitors' first piece of attacking incision halved the deficit, Kyle Walker latching onto a loose ball and whipping a stunning cross that allowed Alli the simple task of nodding home from inside the six-yard box - Claudio Bravo conceding the first shot at him for the fifth time in eight games.",
                "Danny Rose hooked the ball away from Sterling as he bore down on goal, amid calls for a penalty, but referee Andre Marriner baffled the home crowd when the England attacker was one-on-one with Lloris, only to have his shooting stride interrupted by a clear shove in the back from Walker.",
                "Lloris subsequently launched a counter-attack and Kane - just offside - touched Christian Eriksen's pass into Son and the South Korean finished with unerring cool.",
                "Jesus was afforded a huge reception as he replaced Sterling and his first touch almost put the winner on a plate for Sane before his own moment of glory was cut short to compound the feeling of deep frustration at the Etihad Stadium."

However, after a very positive start to the campaign they have started to slip down the table and are currently down in sixth. They remain five points clear of the Champions League qualification positions, but do have two games in hand over their rivals."

                "AC Milan recovered from two goals down to draw a thrilling Serie A clash 2-2 at Torino, for whom Adem Ljajic missed a spot-kick to make it 3-0.",
                "Torino were rampant in the first half, Andrea Belotti making it eight goals in his last nine Serie A games before Marco Benassi's impressive flick doubled their lead.",
                "The hosts were threatening to run away with it but Ljajic had his penalty saved by Milan goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma before half-time.",
                "And that allowed Milan to launch a rapid second-half fightback, Andrea Bertolacci getting one back before Carlos Bacca scored from a penalty of his own on the hour mark.",
                "Neither side went on to find a decisive third goal, Milan's Alessio Romagnoli sent off a minute from time for a second booking. Torino have only won against the Rossoneri in one of their last 40 top-flight meetings while Sinisa Mihajlovic has failed to beat his former club in three attempts this season.",
                "Fifth-placed Milan have won just one of their last four league games, but sit within four points of Napoli in third ahead of their crunch clash at San Siro on Saturday. Vincenzo Montella's men still hold a game in hand on most of their rivals for a Champions League spot.",
                "Mid-table Torino, meanwhile, have just one victory in six top-flight games after surrendering their lead, although Juventus remain the only team to have beaten them in 10 home games.",
                "Belotti came into the game in fine form and it was he who struck in the 21st minute when Iago Falque found Ljajic and his attempted shot was steered in by the striker.",
                "Five minutes later it was two for the hosts after Milan had twice failed to clear the danger. Belotti picked up the loose ball and linked up with Falque, whose pass was brilliantly flicked in by Benassi, with Romagnoli unable to clear from the goal-line.",
                "Torino then squandered a glorious chance to put the result beyond doubt just after the half-hour mark.",
                "A penalty was awarded when Antonio Barreca made ground down the left wing and went down under a clip from Ignazio Abate, but Ljajic fired a dreadful spot-kick straight at Donnarumma and Falque lashed the rebound wide.",
                "Joe Hart was called upon for first time prior to the break, rising high to keep out a long-range shot from Suso before also denying Bertolacci to preserve his side's two-goal advantage.",
                "But Milan did beat Hart within 10 minutes of the restart, Abate's cross from the right leading to chaos in the Torino defence and Bertolacci defeated the England keeper from close range at the second attempt.",
                "Benassi thought he had made an instant response for Torino but was correctly flagged for offside after prodding in when Donnarumma parried Falque's strike.",
                "An end-to-end clash continued with Hart making a magnificent diving save from Gabriel Paletta's header following Suso's cross, before Milan drew level.",
                "From the resulting corner, Luca Rossettini was all over Paletta, prompting referee Paolo Tagliavento to point to the spot for the second time and Bacca did not make the same mistake as Ljajic, comfortably sending Hart the wrong way for his eighth top-flight goal of the campaign.",
                "Torino attempted to re-assert themselves as Belotti shot off-target with a presentable chance and Donnarumma saved well from Ljajic.",
                "But Mihajlovic's side were forced to settle for an entertaining draw soured slightly by Romagnoli receiving his second yellow for a foul on Belotti.",

                "Having already set up a gilt-edged chance for Ramadan Sobhi, Arnautovic took matters into his own hands after 29 minutes with a sublime turn and finish, before bundling home his second prior to the interval.",
                "Arnautovic's afternoon came to a premature end through injury midway through the second half, though it mattered little as Aitor Karanka's visiting side failed to find a way back into the contest, with Ben Gibson seeing a strike ruled out for offside.",

                "Joe Allen and Arnautovic combined brilliantly to tee-up Sobhi, but the youngster could only rattle the woodwork from point-blank range.",
                "Middlesbrough were exposed again soon after, Victor Valdes reacting instinctively to deny Peter Crouch following sloppy play from Grant Leadbitter.",
                "But the away team's luck ran out just prior to the half-hour mark, Arnautovic getting the better of both George Friend and Valdes with a series of exquisite touches before thumping home from a tight angle.",
                "And he wasted little time in adding to his tally, with slack Middlesbrough defending allowing the Austrian to smuggle in Stoke's second three minutes before half-time, moments after Leadbitter had gone close at the other end.",
                "Arnautovic should have turned provider following the restart, but after engineering space with another neat turn, he failed to pick out Sobhi with a disappointing cross.",
                "Gibson thought he had ended Middlesbrough's three-game goal drought in the league when he slotted home on the hour mark, but it was swiftly disallowed.",
                "While Middlesbrough rallied somewhat - Gaston Ramirez trying his luck from range with a stinging strike - Stoke were forced into a change, Mark Hughes taking no risks with Arnautovic after the winger picked up a knock.",
                "Despite Middlesbrough's tame attack, Karanka chose not to introduce Alvaro Negredo from the bench as the game wore on, and the visitors created little going forward.",
                "Indeed, it was Stoke who almost added gloss to the victory late on, Valdes on top form to deny both Sobhi and Ibrahim Afellay as Middlesbrough slumped to a 13th successive away league game without a win."

                "Wilfried Zaha and Andros Townsend were on target as Crystal Palace moved out of the relegation zone with a crucial 2-0 win at West Brom on Saturday.",
                "After an uneventful first half at The Hawthorns it was Palace that took a 55th-minute lead through Ivory Coast winger Zaha following a great ball from Yohan Cabaye for his first Eagles goal since January 3.",
                "Palace then put the game beyond all doubt in the closing stages when Townsend completed a swift break from the visitors.",
                "It marks another huge boost for Palace following their 1-0 win over relegation rivals Middlesbrough last week, and Sam Allardyce's side now leapfrog Aitor Karanka's men into 17th.",
                "West Brom had plenty of cause for optimism heading into the match having taken 11 points from their past league matches and going unbeaten since a 4-0 loss to Tottenham on January 14.",
                "Tony Pulis had little to shout about against his former club, though, and West Brom - who remain eighth in the table - can have few complaints about the result.",
                "There was little action in a tepid opening, but Palace had the first chance of note when Christian Benteke beat his marker from Cabaye's corner, only to see his fine header cleared off the goalline by Chris Brunt with goalkeeper Ben Foster well beaten.",
                "The hosts struggled to create anything of note going forward with Palace's defence marshalling Salomon Rondon well, and the striker was fortunate to escape punishment for a dive late in the first half following a duel with Cabaye.",
                "West Brom seemingly awoke from their slumber and Nacer Chadli tested Wayne Hennessey with a low shot from outside the area.",
                "The impressive Zaha continued to cause the hosts problems, though, and he was unlucky not to double his side's lead after a superb dribble from which Foster did just enough to save his shot, with Jason Puncheon failing to find the net from the rebound.",
                "The winger had failed to beat Foster from close range with 10 minutes left on the clock, but he made amends when he fired home from inside the box after a rapid counter-attack to seal the win."

                "The towering striker made the difference with a superb header just before the hour mark after Peter Ankersen's sublime cross from the right, beating Matthijs de Ligt in the air to leave goalkeeper Andre Onana without a chance.",
                "The Danish champions had previously gone a goal up through Rasmus Falk after just 27 seconds, only for Kasper Dolberg to score a controversial equaliser from what seemed like an offside position, but there would be no denying the home side in the end.",
                "Copenhagen were brimming with confidence heading into Thursday's encounter following their superb home form over the past 18 months, last conceding in an official game at Telia Parken back in August 2016 and going unbeaten ever since a 3-2 defeat against Jablonec in August 2015.",
                "Ajax, meanwhile, had every reason for optimism as well, having won five of their eight prior Europa League encounters this term and drawing the remaining three.",
                "It was Copenhagen that dominated proceedings, though, and Cornelius' second-half strike would eventually prove to be decisive.",
                "Copenhagen charged forward right from the start and needed less than a minute to open the scoring through Falk. The midfielder escaped the attention of Lasse Schone after a clever pass from William Kvist and beat Onana with a fine volley from a narrow angle.",
                "The hosts continued to cause Ajax all kinds of trouble early on and Youssef Toutouh could have doubled his side's lead after a long throw-in from Kvist, blasting a shot just wide of the target after Federico Santander had headed the ball into his path.",
                "The Amsterdammers slowly grew into the game and Dolberg restored parity in the 32nd minute with a sublime finish from what appeared to be an illegal position. Davy Klaassen sent in a fine cross from the right and the Denmark international did well to hold off Ankersen before volleying home.",
                "Ajax made an encouraging start to the second half and could have grabbed the lead when the unmarked Schone got a chance to try his luck from the edge of the box, only for the experienced midfielder to aim yards wide.",
                "Copenhagen had struggled to get going after the restart, but they went 2-1 up with their first chance of note after the break, Cornelius beating Onana with a strong header after outmuscling De Ligt in the 59th minute.",
                "Ajax boss Peter Bosz brought on big-money signings Hakim Ziyech and David Neres in the closing stages of the game as the visitors went in search of an equaliser.",
                "Klaassen was unfortunate to be denied by a fine save from Robin Olsen, before Dolberg had a goal disallowed in the 88th minute for a foul on Uros Matic as it ended 2-1."

                "Ramadan Sobhi cleverly turned Nicolas Otamendi on the left side of the area and darted towards the danger zone, but Bacary Sagna made a vital intervention before Diouf could pounce.",

                "Silva went close twice in quick succession as the match approached its final 15 minutes – first agonisingly missing the bottom-right corner from just inside the box, before drilling wide of the opposite post from distance.",
                "Aguero almost stunned Stoke at the death when slipped into the left side of the box, but the Argentinian could only find the side-netting as Stoke secured a solid point."

                "Defoe's quickfire double in first-half stoppage time came as part of a sensational five-minute spell in which Sunderland struck three times and put the game beyond doubt to end a run of six winless top-flight matches.",
                "The Black Cats join Palace on 19 points but remain bottom due to Hull City's surprise 2-0 victory over Liverpool, with former Sunderland manager Sam Allardyce failing to build on his first Premier League triumph in charge of the Eagles in midweek.",
                "Allardyce named an unchanged line-up from Tuesday's 2-0 win at Bournemouth, but they fell behind to Lamine Kone's strike - though questions may be asked as to whether Billy Jones fouled Wayne Hennessey in the build-up.",
                "Didier Ndong scored his first Sunderland goal with a brilliant 25-yard strike in the 43rd minute, before Defoe's brace prompted jeers from the Selhurst Park faithful with one fan running on to remonstrate with defender Damien Delaney.",
                "David Moyes' team, who held title challengers Tottenham to a goalless draw in midweek, rested on their comfortable cushion in the second period, seeing out a confidence-boosting victory in which they matched the amount of goals scored in their previous nine away matches.",
                "Palace came under early pressure and fell behind in controversial circumstances after 10 minutes.",
                "Hennessey spilled the ball under a challenge from Jones which referee Andre Marriner did not deem a foul, and Kone reacted quickly by following up his initial header with a volley from the floor.",
                "Palace found it difficult to break down Moyes' well-organised side and James Tomkins failed to make the most of a rare chance when he headed wide from inside the six-yard box.",
                "Yohan Cabaye was unable to run off a knock and was replaced by Joe Ledley in the 27th minute, and a loose touch from the Wales international was punished by Ndong when he rifled a brilliant 25-yard shot in off the right-hand post.",
                "That kick-started a sensational end to the first half, with Defoe making an untracked run into the area and drilling a cool finish across Hennessey in the first minute of stoppage time.",
                "The former England striker added his second two minutes later, latching onto Adnan Januzaj's excellent throughball before turning Tomkins and firing home to send Palace down the tunnel amid a chorus of boos.",
                "4 - Crystal Palace have conceded four first half goals in a Premier League match for the first time. Shock.",
                "Injuries to Jack Rodwell – who ended his remarkable run of 37 winless Premier League starts for the Black Cats – and John O'Shea enabled Darron Gibson and Joleon Lescott to make their Sunderland debuts shortly after the restart.",
                "Palace's lacklustre attempts to try to reduce the deficit proved fruitless, Christian Benteke sending an overhead kick way off target in the 72nd minute.",
                "Januzaj arrowed an effort narrowly wide before injury saw him make way for Steven Pienaar.",
                "Jason Denayer produced a brilliant goal-line clearance to stop Jason Puncheon's shot from the edge of the box, and Benteke shot narrowly wide, ensuring a fourth top-flight clean sheet of the season for Sunderland.",
                "For Palace, the afternoon ended with angry fans hurling abuse at their players as they left the field."

                "A home crowd peppered with banners paying tribute to the amiable Italian, who was sacked last Thursday following a run of five consecutive top-flight defeats, had no cause to approach mutiny as their side located an intensity and drive sorely lacking over recent weeks.",
                "Vardy followed his strike in the 2-1 Champions League loss to Sevilla last week with Leicester's first in the Premier League in 2017 and Danny Drinkwater displayed impeccable technique to net a sumptuous long-range second.",
                "It got better in the second half when Vardy headed in a third and, although Philippe Coutinho pulled one back for Liverpool, the Foxes moved out of the bottom three and the famous namesake of Leicester's interim boss Craig Shakespeare could barely have scripted a better initial pitch for him to take the job on a full-time basis.",
                "The day-to-day in such roles provides considerable headaches, as Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp will attest. A 16-day break from action and a training trip to La Manga seemingly did little for Liverpool's competitive edge as they fell well short of the swashbuckling brilliance that took down Tottenham last time out.",
                "Like Leicester, they have only one Premier League win this calendar year and are in fifth having played a game more than Manchester City and Arsenal in third and fourth, while sixth-placed Manchester United are a point behind with a game in hand.",
                "Shinji Okazaki replaced Ahmed Musa in a Leicester starting XI that reverted predominantly to the shape and personnel that brought them glory last season and the Japan international was to the fore in a positive start from the hosts - Simon Mignolet keeping out a clever seventh-minute header.",
                "The sight of Liverpool's defence retreating under a high ball forward from Kasper Schmeichel and being put under further pressure by a fine Vardy touch provided another flashback to Leicester's title heroics.",
                "As has often been the case this time around, the England striker's finish was lacking, though he made amends in the 28th minute when Drinkwater slid a pass through a generously positioned Liverpool backline.",
                "Schmeichel was out quickly to prevent Coutinho registering a swift equaliser but Liverpool's lethargy remained and, after Vardy's backheel found Wilfried Ndidi to draw another stop from Mignolet, Leicester spectacularly doubled their lead.",
                "Klopp's side finally settled into a sustained spell of convincing, probing possession early in the second period but Schmeichel saw Coutinho's shot all the way from 20 yards.",
                "Title-winning captain Wes Morgan offered a demonstration of the defensive solidity that has appeared beyond him this time around by deflecting a Sadio Mane effort behind and the King Power erupted once more after an hour.",
                "Schmeichel's best work of the night came springing to his left to deny Adam Lallana, shortly before Ranieri was serenaded, and paid tribute to, with lights held aloft throughout the stadium after 65 minutes.",
                "However, Leicester retained their poise, with Drinkwater narrowly missing out on his second by blasting over, and they must ensure a win that echoed their 4-2 December destruction of Manchester City is not a similarly isolated event."

                "PSG were knocked out of the competition by Barcelona in 2013 and 2015 but Luis Enrique's side now require a comeback unprecedented in Champions League history having been put to the sword in the French capital.",
                "Di Maria, celebrating his 29th birthday, dispatched a free-kick that rewarded PSG's dominant start and Unai Emery's men never relinquished their grip on the first leg of the last-16 tie.",
                "Former Sevilla boss Emery had only beaten Barcelona once in 23 previous attempts but he was well on his way to number two when Julian Draxler scored on his Champions League debut for PSG, as he did in Ligue 1 and the Coupe de France last month.",
                "The visitors completely failed to regroup at the break and a sublime third from Di Maria's magical left foot was followed by Edinson Cavani's 32nd of the season in the 71st minute – capping a night of almost incomprehensible misery for their esteemed opponents.",

                "The hosts made their fast start tell in the 18th minute when, after Samuel Umtiti clattered through Draxler on the edge of the area, Di Maria whipped a fine free-kick beyond a disorganised wall to leave Ter Stegen with no chance.",
                "Before the half-hour, Neymar shrugged off an earlier blow to his foot by gliding forward from his own half and playing in Andre Gomes, who forced Kevin Trapp to save with his feet.",
                "Barcelona's first sustained spell of pressure only served to leave them vulnerable on the counter-attack - Germany winger Draxler skipping past Roberto to be denied by his compatriot Ter Stegen at the near post.",
                "And Lionel Messi found himself in the unusual position of being to blame for an opposition goal five minutes before the interval.",
                "The irrepressible Adrien Rabiot hounded him out of possession with the assistance of Marco Verratti and the Italy midfielder twice exchanged possession with Draxler for PSG's showpiece January arrival to arrow home a low shot.",
                "Half-time did little to clear Barcelona's heads as Rabiot made a nuisance of himself once more, springing onto a second ball and into a crowded area to clip a shot past the far post.",
                "Cavani had to wait for his 32nd of the season when he failed to head in Matuidi's centre but it mattered little as Di Maria brought a raucous Parc des Princes to its feet in the 55th minute.",
                "The move started with goalkeeper Trapp feeding Rabiot, who drove at Barcelona once more.",
                "A combination of Rabiot and left-back Layvin Kurzawa allowed Draxler to tear at a beleaguered defence. He fed Di Maria and, as Andres Iniesta flailed in the challenge, the Argentina star curled in a sumptuous strike from 25 yards.",
                "Di Maria departed to a standing ovation after the hour, although the brilliant but injury prone Verratti did not enjoy such a satisfying end to his evening when he hobbled off in discomfort with 20 minutes to play.",
                "However, the last thing Barcelona needed was fresh PSG legs and they laboured as Thomas Meunier strode forward unchallenged, playing in Cavani to emphatically slam past Ter Stegen.",
                "Umtiti headed against the post in the 83rd minute but Barcelona were unable to move beyond base camp of the mountain they must somehow attempt to scale in next month's return at Camp Nou."

                "Faraoni was forced off due to that collision, while Bonaventura also had his match ended early by injury, with Deulofeu taking his place.",
                "The changes did little to upset Udinese's rhythm, however, and they deservedly drew level just after the half-hour mark.",
                "Milan looked brighter early in the second half, coinciding with Deulofeu starting to make a nuisance of himself.",
                "The on-loan Everton man cut in from the left and brilliantly found Suso in the far side of the area, but his eventual effort was deflected wide.",
                "Deulofeu then picked out a clever reverse pass to Carlos Bacca after another darting run, with the Colombian's 20-yard effort fumbled by Orestis Karnezis.",
                "Milan's inability to capitalise on their pressure ultimately contributed to their downfall.",
                "Milan almost drew level three minutes from time as substitute Gianluca Lapadula hit the post from a tight angle, but Udinese managed to see it out and hold on to the victory."

                "Neither side were finished there, though, Harry Arter clawing one back for the visitors prior to Ross Barkley tucking in Everton's sixth in stoppage time to cap another remarkable meeting between the two sides.",
                "McCarthy was one of three changes Koeman made from the draw at Stoke City, and he wasted no time in repaying his manager's faith as Everton raced ahead inside a minute.",
                "That goal set the tone for Everton, and they very nearly had a second soon after - full debutant Ademola Lookman dragging a strike wide after getting the better of Arter.",
                "Both goalkeepers were called into action prior to the interval, Boruc reacting sharply to deny Seamus Coleman before Joel Robles parried away Steve Cook's venomous strike.",
                "McCarthy should have immediately restored Everton's three-goal cushion, but his hesitation allowed Boruc to make a fine save, with Lookman unable to finish on the follow-up."

                "The Hornets, who were winless in seven league games, made an incredible start to race into a 2-0 lead inside 13 minutes on Tuesday, with two former Tottenham players central to Arsenal's downfall.",
                "Younes Kaboul's deflected free-kick opened the scoring, while Etienne Capoue pounced on Gabriel's loose throw before venturing forward unchallenged and drawing a save from Petr Cech, from which Troy Deeney pounced on the rebound.",
                "It should have served as a wake-up call to Arsenal, for whom manager Arsene Wenger is still serving a touchline ban, but it was the visitors who remained on the front foot and they saw efforts from Sebastian Prodl and Miguel Britos repelled before the end of a first half in which Aaron Ramsey was forced off injured.",
                "Theo Walcott, fresh from his hat-trick in Saturday's 5-0 FA Cup win over Southampton, came on for the second half and Arsenal immediately carried a greater threat, the England forward finally calling Heurelho Gomes into meaningful action.",
                "It was Alex Iwobi who pulled one back, volleying in Alexis Sanchez's cross as Wenger's men made their dominance of the ball count.",
                "Substitute Lucas Perez struck the crossbar five minutes from time but, having weathered the storm, Walter Mazzarri's side clung on to claim a win that ought to quieten speculation over the Italian's future.",
                "Watford, who handed a debut to AC Milan loanee M'Baye Niang, broke the deadlock in fortuitous circumstances after 10 minutes. Kaboul's speculative 25-yard strike was powerful but would not have unduly troubled Cech had it not been for a sizeable deflection off Ramsey.",
                "The Welshman's evening got worse when Gabriel's throw-in eluded him and Capoue seized on the loose ball, his run ending with a shot that came off Cech's leg and left Deeney with a tap-in.",
                "Ramsey's miserable cameo came to an end midway through the half, the midfielder limping off with an apparent calf injury.",
                "Watford, who confirmed the big-money sale of Odion Ighalo to Chinese Super League club Changchun Yatai prior to the match, continued to press and Prodl's header forced a fingertip stop from Cech, while Britos' effort was blocked by Olivier Giroud.",
                "For their part, Arsenal looked a world away from the side that was so dominant at St Mary's Stadium, with the home fans growing increasingly restless.",
                "Walcott's introduction in place of Giroud helped to get the Gunners going and he fired an angled shot narrowly wide within three minutes of the restart.",
                "The former Saints forward was presented with a glorious chance to reduce the deficit two minutes later, shooting tamely at another of Watford's ex-Spurs charges as Gomes saved with his legs before brilliantly thwarting Iwobi.",
                "But Iwobi was not to be denied when, in the 58th minute, he connected with Sanchez's chipped delivery to find the far post and breathe new life into Arsenal's challenge.",
                "Mazzarri's side, beaten by League One Milwall in the FA Cup on Sunday, suddenly looked vulnerable every time Arsenal attacked and had to dig deep to stifle a forward line now led by Sanchez through the middle.",
                "It was an unlikely source from which the next moment of danger came, Nacho Monreal firing in a fine volley that swerved wide of Gomes' right-hand upright.",
                "With time running out, the Gunners saw Perez rattle the woodwork with a strike that had Gomes beaten, but the Hornets were perhaps deserving of that late piece of luck as they inflicted Arsenal's first home league defeat since their opening game of the campaign.",

Sassuolo remain comfortably clear of the relegation zone, with a trip to immediate rivals Genoa awaiting on Sunday.",

                "Taking the lead served to settle the champions and they doubled their advantage in style in the 25th minute. Higuain closed down veteran Paolo Cannavaro and won possession in a dangerous area before cutting a pass back into the box. Paulo Dybala then fooled the Sassuolo defence with a wonderful dummy and Khedira arrived to smash the ball into the top corner of the net.",

                "Fiorentina, in contrast, had come into the game in decent form having lost only one of their last five games in all competitions but they missed the chance to climb above the home side.",

Sosa delivered the outswinging free kick and Kucka took advantage of some slack marking to glance an unstoppable header past Ciprian Tatarusanu.",

                "And although the hard-working Chiesa then dragged two cross-shots across the face of goal as the home defence continued to creak, the visitors faded a little in the final quarter, perhaps feeling the effects of Thursday's Europa League trip to Borussia Monchengladbach.",

                "After suffering successive defeats to Lazio in the Coppa Italia and Juventus in Serie A, Inter produced a committed display, despite lacking some of their brightest attacking talents.",
                "Ivan Perisic and Mauro Icardi were both suspended after the tempestuous 1-0 defeat to Juventus the previous week, but Stefano Pioli's combination of Joao Mario, Rodrigo Palacio and Eder in attack quickly paid off when the Italy striker put his side ahead after 14 minutes.",
                "Eder turned provider for Antonio Candreva for Inter's second, and Pioli will have been encouraged by the way his players applied themselves in a tricky fixture against well-organised opponents as victory maintained their place within six points of third-placed Napoli.",
                "Empoli, still eight points above the drop zone, showed themselves capable of competing with the league's top sides when it comes to possession in midfield, but their reliance on veteran striker Massimo Maccarone in attack was not enough to threaten Inter's defence.",
                "In the absence of the suspended Icardi, Pioli started with Palacio as the spearhead of his attack and the veteran striker was denied the opening goal when his header was saved acrobatically by Lukasz Skorupski in the Empoli goal after 10 minutes.",
                "Inter cranked up the pressure on the Empoli goal and it paid off after just 14 minutes when Candreva's deflected cross looped up in the air and Palacio headed it across the face of goal for Eder to bundle the ball home with his chest.",
                "Omar El Kaddouri curled a shot towards goal as Empoli's neat passing in midfield yielded a chance for the visitors but Samir Handanovic parried it away, and at the other end Roberto Gagliardini was denied his first goal in Serie A when Skorupski turned his powerful close-range drive over the crossbar.",
                "Having worked hard to stay in the game in the first half, Empoli should have drawn level early in the second when Rade Krunic went through on goal and only a good one-handed save by Handanovic kept his shot out.",
                "That miss proved crucial, as seconds later Inter doubled their lead when Eder's sublime cross found Candreva at the far post and he instinctively fired a first-time shot into the net to make it 2-0.",
                "Maccarone went one-on-one with Handanovic but failed in his attempt to chip the goalkeeper, and Pioli sent on Gabriel Barbosa for the final 20 minutes as Inter sought to wrap up the victory.",
                "Daniele Croce tried a spectacular volley that Handanovic parried away as Empoli refused to lie down, while Pioli used the last 10 minutes of the game to hand a Serie A debut to 17-year-old striker Andrea Pinamonti, who tested Skorupski from range before ending his first appearance on a winning team."

                "It was an unhappy return to Goodison Park for David Moyes as Romelu Lukaku wrapped up Sunderland's 2-0 defeat at Everton on Saturday and prevented them from lifting themselves off the bottom of the Premier League table.",
                "Moyes, who spent 11 and a half years managing Everton, found himself back at Goodison for the first time since a 2-0 defeat in April 2014 resulted in his Manchester United dismissal, but his current charges rarely looked capable of recording an upset and their lack of luck was summed up by Jermain Defoe striking the crossbar just before Lukaku's late clincher.",
                "Everton controlled what was a one-sided first half and, although Sunderland did improve as it progressed, the hosts deservedly led at the break thanks to Idrissa Gueye's fine strike.",
                "The visitors looked a greater attacking threat after half-time, though their lack of creativity meant Everton remained relatively comfortable at the back – Joel Robles rarely finding himself involved.",
                "The previously anonymous Defoe was finally presented with an opening 12 minutes from time, only to see his effort come back off the frame of the goal.",
                "And Lukaku took full advantage of that let-off, finding the net on the break shortly after to secure an Everton win with his 17th league goal of the season and keep the pressure on in the race to finish in the European places.",
                "It took a purposeful Everton seven minutes to craft their first chance, as Ademola Lookman met Leighton Baines' pass just inside the area and saw his effort spilled by Jordan Pickford, but the goalkeeper – back after two months out – recovered and stopped it on the line.",
                "Pickford was called into action again 13 minutes later and he was rather more assertive this time as he kept Gueye out from a tight angle after the midfielder robbed Billy Jones and darted into the left side of the box.",
                "Sunderland finally found a foothold with Adnan Januzaj looking lively down the right, but they failed to test Robles and left themselves open to counter-attacks.",
                "And Everton eventually broke their resolve on the break five minutes before half-time – Gueye latching on to Seamus Coleman's cut-back and applying an emphatic finish from 16 yards.",
                "They almost added a second at the end of the half, but Tom Davies' 20-yard drive came back off the right-hand post.",
                "Sunderland's improvement continued after the break as they looked to put Everton under more meaningful pressure.",
                "They kept plugging away and at no stage of the second period did Sunderland find themselves clinging on at the back.",
                "And they went agonisingly close to securing a potentially vital equaliser, Sunderland catching Everton short of numbers at the back only for Defoe's 16-yard effort to crash back off the underside of the crossbar.",
                "That escape gave Everton the jolt they needed to finish things off.",
                "Lukaku charged through after being played into the Sunderland half by Kevin Mirallas and the striker held off Bryan Oviedo before slotting past Pickford.",
                "Substitute Enner Valencia was then denied when one-on-one with Pickford as Everton looked to further crush Sunderland's morale, but it mattered little for the hosts, who extended their unbeaten run to nine league games."

                "Sadio Mane was the hero as Liverpool recorded their first Premier League win of 2017 with a 2-0 victory over a Tottenham side whose title ambitions were left floundering.",
                "Jurgen Klopp's side badly missed Mane when he left for Africa Cup of Nations duty and the Senegal international struck twice in three first-half minutes to stir the Reds from their torpor at Anfield.",
                "Until Saturday, the only win Liverpool – now nine unbeaten against Spurs in the top flight – had managed this year was in an FA Cup replay against fourth-tier Plymouth Argyle, with defeats to strugglers Swansea City and Hull City along the way.",
                "It is a run that has almost certainly scuppered their dreams of competing with Chelsea for top spot, but they brought Spurs' own bid down in flames with a stunning display.",
                "Mauricio Pochettino's side were not at the races for the opening 30 minutes particularly and had survived a couple of nervy moments even before Mane broke the deadlock in the 16th minute.",
                "He quickly added a second as Ben Davies was caught napping and the game could have been put out of sight before the break, but Hugo Lloris denied Mane a third with a fine save.",
                "The visitors regrouped for the second half, but could do little to truly trouble a Liverpool side determined to keep a grip on three precious points – their first since defeating Manchester City on the final day of 2016.",
                "The result means Liverpool have taken 16 points from a possible 24 against fellow top-six sides and they climb to fourth, back above Manchester United and one point behind second-placed Spurs.",
                "Klopp's side were positive from the outset and it took some desperate defending from Tottenham to thwart the hosts when Philippe Coutinho looked for the bottom-right corner deep inside the box.",
                "The former Southampton forward should have had a hat-trick by the 22nd minute, but he failed to beat Lloris after capitalising on a defensive error from Davies, who tried to make amends by teeing up Son Heung-min, though his shot was tame and easily saved.",
                "Dele Alli then saw a goalbound effort diverted over the crossbar by stand-in defender Lucas Leiva, with Spurs beginning to show the kind of spark that had led them on a nine-match unbeaten run in the league.",
                "Spurs were much better organised after the interval and Harry Kane hit the post, though the flag had been raised for offside against the England striker.",
                "Joel Matip's header, which proved straightforward for Lloris, served as a reminder of Liverpool's threat, but the home side were mostly content to slow things down.",
                "Tottenham had very little answer to that approach and, indeed, they still had to soak up some pressure, with Coutinho drilling wide from the edge of the box in one of the few chances of a second half that saw seven yellow cards.",
                "Liverpool do not return to action until February 27, while Tottenham face Europa League and FA Cup matches in a bid to keep their hopes of silverware alive.",
                "Meanwhile, Chelsea head to Burnley on Sunday knowing a win will move them 12 points clear, with Antonio Conte's side having dropped only 13 points all season."

                "Pescara's form coming into the contest was in stark contrast to Inter's, having lost 10 in 12 in Serie A, and the only surprising aspect of the hosts' opening goal was that it took 23 minutes to arrive.",
                "Danilo D'Ambrosio was the one to break Pescara's resolve and Joao Mario added a second just before the break to effectively put the game beyond the relegation favourites.",
                "Inter were significantly less dominant after the interval, as they sat back and appeared content to let Pescara have the ball.",
                "But they did eventually finish things off, as second-half substitute Eder converted shortly after his introduction, wrapping up a routine triumph to strengthen their challenge for a Champions League spot.",
                "Rock-bottom Pescara were unsurprisingly subjected to relentless pressure right from the start in Milan and, although the home side took a little while to click in the final third, the visitors struggled to contain them.",
                "That goal gave Inter further encouragement and Ivan Perisic nearly added another just after the half-hour mark, seeing his curling left-footed effort go just wide from 25 yards.",
                "But the Portugal international made amends just before the break, latching on to Perisic's teasing delivery to give Inter a two-goal cushion.",
                "Inter appeared to ease off a little at the start of the second half, allowing Pescara to see more of the ball and as a result they almost pulled one back in the 59th minute.",
                "Jean-Christophe Bahebeck burst into the left side of the Inter box and saw his shot blocked by Samir Handanovic, before Valerio Verre smashed the rebound just over.",
                "That let-off seemed to jolt Inter back into life and a few moments later Perisic again went close from 25 yards, as the home side looked to finish Pescara off."

Consigli's heroics, though, were not enough to earn Sassuolo a share of the points."

                "Though he produced a string of quality saves to keep the visitors at bay - a finger-tip stop from Ramiro Funes Mori the highlight - Hennessey could do nothing to prevent Coleman thumping in an 87th-minute winner.",
                "Palace, who slipped into the relegation zone prior to kick-off thanks to Swansea City's shock victory at Liverpool, had started in lively fashion - Christian Benteke hitting the woodwork - and the hosts would have taken a late lead themselves if not for Joel Robles excellent save.",
                "It appeared that Everton would have to settle for a share of the spoils, but Coleman came up with the goods late on, ensuring a fourth win in six league fixtures for Ronald Koeman's men.",

                "Benteke's double ensured FA Cup progression for Palace against Bolton Wanderers, and the Belgian went agonisingly close to putting the hosts ahead early on this time around.",
                "Former Liverpool forward Benteke, who netted in the reverse fixture at Goodison Park in September, expertly headed James McArthur's excellent cross goalwards, leaving Robles flat-footed, only for the ball to bounce away off the crossbar.",
                "Everton responded well, Hennessey pulling off fine saves to deny Kevin Mirallas and Ross Barkley as the visitors began to assert some authority.",
                "Barkley looked to have put Koeman's side ahead having hammered home on the rebound after Romelu Lukaku - making his 150th Everton appearance - had hit the post, but the England midfielder was rightly flagged offside.",
                "Palace survived another scare soon afterwards, Hennessey reacting superbly to turn Funes Mori's rasping effort over.",

                "Barkley went close again moments later, sliding a cross-cum-shot wide before Lukaku headed over from Everton's next attack.",
                "Looking to capitalise on Everton's strong start to the second half, Koeman introduced Morgan Schneiderlin on the hour-mark, while youngster Ademola Lookman also came on.",
                "Scott Dann thought he had claimed a vital win for Palace with 11 minutes remaining, but Robles was on hand to parry the defender's header wide with an instinctive stop."

                "Patrick van Aanholt's first goal for the club, 11 minutes before half-time, proved the difference in a nervy match that was typical of the relegation battle.",
                "Both sides had endured miserable league runs heading into this clash, with Boro winless in eight, but it was Palace who secured a rare victory - just their third since September.",
                "Van Aanholt's effort ensured Sam Allardyce's side headed into the break in front, and it had appeared at that stage as though the home side would cruise to a crucial three points.",
                "But Boro rallied, with Cristhian Stuani missing a huge chance to equalise, and Palace had to battle hard to see out a spell of sustained pressure and move out of the bottom three, level on points with the visitors.",
                "Allardyce had, on Friday, called for his team to play an \"uglier\" brand of football in order to beat the drop, and Palace repeatedly sought a direct route to goal in a scrappy opening period.",
                "Christian Benteke, the hosts' most obvious aerial threat, nodded a first chance straight at Victor Valdes and then headed over the crossbar.",
                "But it was a failed Boro header that presented Palace with the opener after 34 minutes.",
                "Yohan Cabaye's shot was blocked inside the area but, following Daniel Ayala's weak clearance, the Frenchman was able to tee up Van Aanholt for a bobbling right-footed effort that crept beyond Valdes into the bottom-right corner.",
                "The home side, encouraged by this somewhat fortunate breakthrough, next attacked through Jason Puncheon as he cut inside from the right to sting Valdes' palms.",
                "Boro, though, were much improved after the break, with Gaston Ramirez's free-kick belatedly forcing a comfortable first save from Wayne Hennessey.",
                "Wilfried Zaha flashed over at the other end, but Hennessey had to be alert to parry Stuani's close-range effort, before Ben Gibson's low strike skipped up into the goalkeeper's arms.",
                "Although Benteke volleyed harmlessly wide, Palace were able to renew their earlier attacking intent and see out the win.",
                "Palace's victory also consigned champions Leicester City to a place in the bottom three for the first time this season, ahead of Monday's clash with Liverpool."

                "Marcos Rojo's maiden Premier League goal gave United a deserved 23rd-minute lead before ex-Red Devils youngster Josh King levelled from the penalty spot.",
                "Ibrahimovic then found himself embroiled in a flashpoint on the stroke of half-time, when Tyrone Mings trod on his head and he responded by elbowing the Bournemouth full-back.",
                "Referee Kevin Friend lost control of the action at that stage as the United favourite escaped further punishment and Andrew Surman received a second booking – the red card came after an embarrassing delay as Friend briefly forgot the yellow he showed the midfielder for a 33rd-minute foul on Luke Shaw.",
                "Ibrahimovic could not make the most of his reprieve as the excellent Artur Boruc saved his 72nd-minute penalty and Jose Mourinho's sixth-placed side miss out on the chance to go fourth.",
                "Wayne Rooney was back in the United starting line-up and the home captain, along with Paul Pogba and Zlatan Ibrahimovic were guilty of early wastefulness as Bournemouth were cut open at will.",
                "Cherries striker Benik Afobe lost his footing when one-on-one with David de Gea but the Spain international's opposite number Artur Boruc remained the busier of the two as he got down to thwart Anthony Martial.",
                "Michael Carrick threaded a magnificent 20th-minute pass through to Martial as Boruc stood firm again and it took a less familiar source to give United the lead.",
                "Carrick played conductor once more, exchanging passes with Pogba and laying the ball out to Antonio Valencia, whose drilled attempt into the box was turned home by Rojo.",
                "The flow of chances quelled after the opener and Bournemouth levelled six minutes before the break – King crashing in a penalty in front of the Stretford End after Phil Jones clumsily felled Marc Pugh.",
                "Ibrahimovic was booked for dissent following that decision and the fired-up Swede was at the centre of a fractious and confused end to the half.",
                "When looking to regain ground following a tackle on Rooney, Mings trod on Ibrahimovic's head. Retribution was swift as United's top scorer elbowed the full-back when the ball entered the Bournemouth box moments later.",
                "In the ensuing melee, Surman shoved Ibrahimovic and was shown a yellow card. It was only as Friend neglected to do likewise to the ex-PSG star that he remembered Surman was previously booked and the Bournemouth man belatedly saw red.",
                "Pogba tested Boruc from long range in the 56th minute as an air of normality returned to proceedings.",
                "The France midfielder then won a free-kick in a dangerous position but Ibrahimovic shot limply into the wall, compounding a frustrating outing.",
                "With 20 minutes left to play, Mourinho unfurled a three-card trick in an attempt to find a way through – Shaw, Carrick and Rooney making way for Jesse Lingard, Marouane Fellaini and Marcus Rashford.",
                "Nevertheless, Ibrahimovic remained flailing at centre stage. After Pogba drew a 71st-minute handball from Adam Smith, the 35-year-old's penalty was not struck cleanly and too close to Boruc, who saved to his right.",
                "Harry Arter should have received a second caution for a lunging tackle on Pogba, whose combined air shot and standing leg effort at close quarters in stoppage time added a fitting final note of farce."

                "The Baggies scored three first-half goals – and could easily have had more – to put the match beyond their beleaguered visitors before the interval, with Scotland trio Matt Phillips, James Morrison and Darren Fletcher on target.",

                "Chris Brunt then tested Tom Heaton with a long-range volley as Pulis' men threatened again, with Burnley finally stirring to life in the 14th minute, only for Hendrick to loop a poor effort wide of the far post when well placed.",
                "It took only two minutes to underline how costly that miss was as Morrison capped a swift counter-attack with an excellent side-footed finish after collecting Rondon's pass.",
                "West Brom continued to push forward and Heaton was again called into action just past the half-hour mark to tip Rondon's curler over the crossbar.",

                "Dyche introduced Ashley Barnes for Steven Defour at the break and the Clarets were marginally better, though never looked likely to make a game of it.",
                "Indeed, their bad night got worse in the 64th minute when Allan Nyom cut the ball back for Rondon, who spun and fired into the net via a deflection.",
                "The late introduction of Andre Gray did little to impact on the overall picture, though Johann Gudmundsson's free-kick had to be tipped onto the crossbar by Ben Foster.",
                "With the destination of the points long since settled, there was an oddly flat atmosphere, but Pulis and his side can reflect on an excellent night's work ahead of Saturday's trip to struggling Hull City."
